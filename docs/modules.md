## An Interactive Curriculum for Ages 9-15

---

### **Introduction for Parents/Teachers**

This curriculum is designed to teach the fundamentals of AI Prompt Engineering to young people in an engaging and spiritually relevant way. It uses timeless biblical stories as case studies to explain modern technological concepts. Each module is designed for an interactive web app, with specific activities for two age groups: **Juniors (9-11)** and **Teens (12-15)**. The "Image Prompts" provided are ready-to-use instructions for AI image generators (like Leonardo.Ai, Midjourney, etc.) to create the visual assets for the app.

> **Image Prompt for Right Column Icon:**
>
> ```
> A clean, modern icon of an open Bible with rays of light gently shining from its pages. Minimalist, flat design, warm gold and white, on a clean background. --style raw
> ```

* **Main Text:** "A prompt is a powerful instruction that makes something happen. God's words in Genesis were the ultimate creative prompts. When we give a prompt to an AI, we are doing the same thing: **using our words to create a result.**"

### **Screen 4: The Digital Workshop (Activity Hub)**

* **Component:** A menu screen: "Choose your challenge!" with two buttons.

#### **Button 1: Juniors (9-11) - "Prompt Detective"**

1. **Activity: Is it a Prompt?**
    * **Component:** `Quiz` (Yes/No).
    * **Task:** Kids read a sentence and decide if it's a prompt (an instruction). They tap 'Yes' or 'No'.
        * "The sun is warm." (No)
        * "Tell me a fact about the sun." (Yes)
        * "David was a king." (No)
        * "Write a short poem about King David." (Yes)
    * **Feedback:** Instant correct/incorrect feedback with fun, encouraging sounds.
2. **Activity: The Command Center**
    * **Component:** `DragAndDrop`.
    * **Task:** A simple sentence builder. Kids drag a verb and a noun into a prompt template to give an AI an instruction.
        * **Template:** "AI, please [VERB] [NOUN]."
        * **Verbs:** "Find," "Draw," "Tell me"
        * **Nouns:** "a map," "a happy face," "a story"

#### **Button 2: Teens (12-15) - "Prompt Engineer's Toolkit"**

1. **Activity: From Wish to Prompt**
    * **Component:** `TextInput` (Before/After).
    * **Task:** The app presents a vague "wish" and the user has to rewrite it as a clear, actionable prompt.
        * **Wish:** "I wish I knew more about Queen Esther."
        * **Your Prompt:** _(User types here, e.g., "Summarize the story of Queen Esther in three paragraphs.")_
2. **Activity: Deconstruct the Prompt**
    * **Component:** `TextInput`.
    * **Task:** The screen shows a prompt: "You are a news reporter. Write a headline about Noah finishing the ark." The app asks: "What is the **instruction** in this prompt? And what **job** (or role) is the AI being asked to do?"

### **Screen 5: The Takeaway (Final Reflection)**

* **Component:** A final summary screen with text and an input field.
* **Summary:** "Today's big idea: A **prompt** is simply an instruction we give to create a result. The better the instruction, the better the result."
* **Life & Faith Connection:** "Our words are powerful. They can create good things or bad things. The Bible tells us in Proverbs 18:21 that 'life and death are in the power of the tongue.' Just like we aim to write good prompts for AI, we should aim to use good, life-giving words with the people around us."
* **Final Interaction:** A text input box asks: "What is one way you can use your words to create something good for someone else this week?"

---

## **Module 2: The Power of Specificity (Vague vs. Valuable)**

**Core Concept:** The more specific and detailed your prompt is, the better and more accurate your result will be.
**Biblical Case Study:** Noah's Ark (Genesis 6).

### **Screen 1: The Concept (The Big Idea)**

* **Component:** A simple, split-screen animation.
* **Visuals:**
  * **Left Side (Vague):** A character says "I want a pet!" to a shopkeeper. The shopkeeper hands them a plain rock with googly eyes. The character looks disappointed.
  * **Right Side (Specific):** The same character says "I would like a small, fluffy, golden puppy with floppy ears!" The shopkeeper hands them that exact puppy. The character is overjoyed.

> **Image Prompt for the 'Specific' scene:**
>
> ```
> A happy cartoon child is being handed a small, fluffy, adorable golden retriever puppy with big floppy ears by a friendly shopkeeper. The scene is full of joy and excitement. Simple, clean lines, vibrant colors, digital illustration for a children's educational app. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text Appears:** "Getting what you want is all about the instructions! It's the same with AI."
* **Core Definition:**
    > **Specificity** (in prompts): Adding details and clear instructions to your prompt so the AI knows _exactly_ what you want it to do.

### **Screen 2: The Biblical Case Study (The Ark Prompt)**

* **Component:** Interactive, click-through story reel.
* **Title:** A Vague Idea vs. A Specific Plan
* **Scene 1: The Vague Idea (Imagination)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> Noah looking confused and scratching his head, staring at a small, poorly made rowboat while storm clouds gather. The boat is clearly not big enough for his family, let alone animals. A comical, worried expression. Storybook digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "Imagine if God had given Noah a vague prompt, like: **'Noah, it's going to rain. Build a boat.'** What would Noah have built? How big would it be? Who would it be for? He would have had to guess."

* **Scene 2: The Specific Prompt (The Bible)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> God's hand, depicted as a gentle cloud of light, showing a detailed blueprint of the ark to Noah, who looks on with awe and understanding. The blueprint has clear lines and measurements visible. Divine, instructional, and clear. Storybook digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "But God didn't give a vague prompt. He gave a very **specific** one! He said: **'Make yourself an ark of cypress wood... It is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high... Make a roof for it... and put a door in the side of the ark.'**"

* **Scene 3: The Building Process**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> Noah and his family working together, happily building the massive, perfectly structured ark. They are using tools, measuring wood, and following the plans precisely. A scene of teamwork and construction. Vibrant and busy digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "Because the instructions were so clear, Noah knew exactly what to do. There was no confusion, no guessing. He and his family could work together to build the ark perfectly, according to the plan."

* **Scene 4: The Perfect Result**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> The magnificent, enormous, completed ark resting on the ground. A long, orderly line of pairs of animals (elephants, giraffes, lions) are happily walking up the ramp into the open door. A sense of fulfillment and readiness. Beautiful storybook illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "And the result? A perfect ark, exactly the right size and strength to save his family and all the animals from the flood. The specific prompt led to a successful result."

### **Screen 3: The Connection (The "Aha!" Moment)**

* **Component:** A clear comparison graphic.
* **Visuals:** Two images side-by-side under a title "Vague vs. Specific".

> **Image Prompt for Left (Vague):**
>
> ```
> A tiny, comical rowboat with a worried-looking hamster inside, floating in a giant puddle. Looks totally inadequate. Humorous, simple cartoon style.
> ```
>
> **Image Prompt for Right (Specific):**
>
> ```
> The huge, strong, impressive Noah's Ark, with pairs of majestic animals looking out from the deck. Looks safe and secure. Awe-inspiring storybook style.
> ```

* **Main Text:** "**Why was specificity so important?** God's detailed prompt removed all guesswork and ensured the ark was strong and big enough for its life-saving mission. In the same way, when you give a detailed prompt to an AI, you remove the guesswork and get a much better, more accurate result."

### **Screen 4: The Digital Workshop (Activity Hub)**

* **Component:** A menu screen: "It's your turn to get specific!"

#### **Button 1: Juniors (9-11) - "The Detail Detective"**

* **Activity:** Add the Details!
  * **Component:** `DragAndDrop`.
  * **Task:** The screen shows a vague prompt: "AI, tell a story about David." Below is a simple, one-sentence output: "David was a king." On the side is a "Detail Bank" with draggable words/phrases like "who was brave," "fought a giant named Goliath," "with a sling and a stone." As kids drag these details into the prompt, the output story on the screen gets longer and more exciting in real-time.

#### **Button 2: Teens (12-15) - "The Prompt Refiner"**

* **Activity:** Level Up The Prompt
  * **Component:** `TextInput` (Before/After).
  * **Task:** The app provides a vague prompt. The user must rewrite it to be more specific and detailed.
    * **Vague Prompt:** "Write a prayer about my day."
    * **Your Refined Prompt:** _(User types here, e.g., "Write a short, personal prayer thanking God for helping me with my math test today, and asking for patience with my younger brother.")_

### **Screen 5: The Takeaway (Final Reflection)**

* **Component:** A final summary screen with text and an input field.
* **Summary:** "Today's big idea: Vague prompts lead to vague results. **Specific prompts lead to specific results.** Adding details is your secret power in prompt engineering!"
* **Life & Faith Connection:** "This is true when we talk to God, too. It’s okay to be specific in your prayers. He cares about the small details of your day. Telling him exactly what you're happy, sad, or worried about can make you feel closer to Him."
* **Final Interaction:** A text input box asks: "Think of one specific thing you are thankful for today. It can be big or small!"

---

## **Module 3: Providing a Persona (The Role-Play Prompt)**

**Core Concept:** You can tell an AI to _act like_ someone or something specific (a persona) to dramatically change the style, tone, and effectiveness of its response.
**Biblical Case Study:** The Prophet Nathan confronting King David (2 Samuel 12).

### **Screen 1: The Concept (The Big Idea)**

* **Component:** A simple, interactive text demonstration.
* **Visuals:** The screen shows a prompt box and an output area.
* **Interaction:**
    1. A default prompt is shown: "Tell the story of Little Red Riding Hood." The user taps "Generate," and a simple, factual summary appears in the output.
    2. The prompt then changes to: "**You are the Big Bad Wolf.** Tell the story of Little Red Riding Hood from your point of view, explaining why you are misunderstood." The user taps "Generate" again. The output is now a completely different story, full of growling, excuses, and wolf-like personality.

> **Image Prompt for the 'Big Bad Wolf' scene:**
>
> ```
> The Big Bad Wolf, looking sly but trying to appear charming, sits in an armchair reading a storybook. He's wearing reading glasses and a grandmother's shawl, winking at the viewer. Humorous, character-focused, storybook digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text Appears:** "Same story, different result! Why? We gave the AI a **persona**."
* **Core Definition:**
    > **Persona** (in prompts): Assigning a role, character, or job to the AI (e.g., "You are a pirate," "You are a helpful scientist") to guide its personality, tone, and style.

### **Screen 2: The Biblical Case Study (The Prophet's Play)**

* **Component:** Interactive, click-through story reel.
* **Title:** A Lesson for a King
* **Scene 1: The Problem**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> King David sitting on a grand throne, looking powerful but with a subtle shadow of sadness or guilt in his eyes. He is in a grand hall, but he looks alone and troubled. Dramatic lighting. Storybook digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "King David was a great king, but he had done something terribly wrong. God sent the prophet Nathan to help David understand his mistake. But how do you correct a powerful king?"

* **Scene 2: The Wrong Prompt (Imagination)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> The prophet Nathan pointing an angry, accusatory finger at King David. King David rises from his throne, looking furious and defensive, with his guards reaching for their swords. A scene of high tension and conflict. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "Nathan couldn't just use a direct, blunt prompt like: **'You sinned!'** A king could get angry, become defensive, and refuse to listen. Nathan needed a better approach."

* **Scene 3: The Persona Prompt (The Bible)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> The prophet Nathan, now looking like a wise and gentle storyteller, sits before King David. David is leaning forward from his throne, listening intently to the story, his expression one of deep concentration and compassion. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "So, Nathan adopted a **persona**. He acted as a **wise storyteller**. He told the king a story about a rich man who stole a poor man's only, beloved little lamb."

* **Scene 4: The Perfect Result**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> King David standing up, filled with righteous anger about the story he just heard. Then, as Nathan says "You are that man!", David's expression changes to one of shock, heartbreak, and dawning realization. A powerful emotional moment. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "The story made David angry at the injustice! But then Nathan revealed the truth: 'You are that man.' By using a story, Nathan bypassed the king's defenses and spoke to his heart. The persona prompt worked perfectly."

### **Screen 3: The Connection (The "Aha!" Moment)**

* **Component:** A clear comparison graphic.
* **Visuals:** Two images side-by-side.

> **Image Prompt for Left (Blunt):**
>
> ```
> An icon of a solid brick wall with an arrow bouncing off it, labeled "Direct Prompt".
> ```
>
> **Image Prompt for Right (Persona):**
>
> ```
> An icon of a key unlocking a heart-shaped lock, labeled "Persona Prompt".
> ```

* **Main Text:** "**Why did the persona work?** A direct accusation would have hit a wall of pride and defensiveness. By adopting the persona of a storyteller, Nathan found the 'key' to unlock David's conscience. When you give an AI a persona, you give it the key to providing the exact tone, style, and perspective you need."

### **Screen 4: The Digital Workshop (Activity Hub)**

* **Component:** A menu screen: "Time to try on some hats!"

#### **Button 1: Juniors (9-11) - "The Costume Box"**

* **Activity:** Choose Your Storyteller!
  * **Component:** `DragAndDrop`.
  * **Task:** The screen has a simple instruction: "Explain why it's good to be kind." Below is an empty output box. On the side is a "Costume Box" with character icons (a brave knight, a silly alien, a wise old grandma). The child drags a character into a "persona slot." The output box then fills with an explanation in that character's voice.
    * **Knight:** "Forsooth! Kindness is a shield of honor that protects the kingdom!"
    * **Alien:** "Beep boop! On my planet, kindness is the fuel that powers our spaceships! Zorp!"

#### **Button 2: Teens (12-15) - "The Persona Studio"**

* **Activity:** You're the Director!
  * **Component:** `TextInput`.
  * **Task:** The app gives a scenario. The user must write a full prompt, including a specific persona, to get the desired result. The app then generates the output based on their prompt.
    * **Scenario:** "You need to convince a friend to try a new, weird-looking but delicious food."
    * **Your Persona Prompt:** _(User types here, e.g., "You are a world-famous, dramatic food critic. Write an over-the-top, exciting description of this new dish, focusing on the amazing flavors.")_

### **Screen 5: The Takeaway (Final Reflection)**

* **Component:** A final summary screen.
* **Summary:** "Today's big idea: Don't just tell the AI _what_ to do, tell it _who to be_. Assigning a **persona** is a pro-level trick for getting the perfect tone and style."
* **Life & Faith Connection:** "This is a superpower in real life, too. It's called empathy! Thinking about a situation from someone else's point of view before you speak can help you be a much kinder, wiser, and more effective friend. Nathan understood his audience (David), and it made all the difference."
* **Final Interaction:** A text input box asks: "Think of a recent conversation. What persona could you have used to make your point in a better way?"

---

## **Module 4: Learning from Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)**

**Core Concept:** You can teach an AI _exactly_ what you want by giving it a few examples of the input and the desired output. This is a powerful way to ensure consistency and correct formatting.
**Biblical Case Study:** Jesus teaching the disciples how to pray (The Lord's Prayer, Matthew 6:9-13).

### **Screen 1: The Concept (The Big Idea)**

* **Component:** A simple, two-stage animation.
* **Visuals:**
    1. **Stage 1 (No Example):** A friendly robot is shown a pile of jumbled letters (A, B, C, D) with the instruction "Make a pattern." The robot looks confused, with a question mark over its head, and just pushes the letters into a messy pile.
    2. **Stage 2 (With Example):** The robot is shown the same letters, but this time with a clear example: `A -> B`. The robot's lightbulb turns on with a "ding!" sound. It immediately arranges the other letters into the correct pattern: `C -> D`.

> **Image Prompt for the robot's 'Aha!' moment:**
>
> ```
> A friendly, cute cartoon robot having a lightbulb moment. A bright yellow lightbulb glows above its head. The robot is looking at a sequence of letters 'A -> B' with a happy, understanding expression. Minimalist, clean background. Digital illustration for a children's educational app. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text Appears:** "Telling is good, but _showing_ is often better! This is a huge secret to prompting."
* **Core Definition:**
    > **Few-Shot Prompting**: Giving the AI a few examples (a "few shots") of what you want, so it can learn the pattern and apply it to new information.

### **Screen 2: The Biblical Case Study (The Perfect Example)**

* **Component:** Interactive, click-through story reel.
* **Title:** How to Talk to God
* **Scene 1: The Question**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> Jesus is praying peacefully under an olive tree, bathed in a soft, gentle light. In the background, his disciples watch him with expressions of awe and curiosity. Storybook digital illustration, warm and serene atmosphere. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "The disciples often saw Jesus praying. They could see his special connection with God, and they wanted to learn. So, they came to him with a question: 'Lord, teach us to pray.'"

* **Scene 2: The Vague Answer (Imagination)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> A group of Jesus's disciples looking at each other with confused and uncertain expressions. They are shrugging their shoulders, as if they've been given a vague instruction they don't understand. Storybook digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "Imagine if Jesus had just said, **'Just talk to God.'** The disciples might have been confused. What should they say? How should they start? They needed a clearer guide."

* **Scene 3: The Example Prompt (The Bible)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> Jesus sitting with his disciples in a circle, teaching them kindly. He has his hands open as if presenting a gift. The words "Our Father in heaven..." appear in the air as soft, glowing letters. A scene of gentle instruction. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "But Jesus didn't give a vague answer. He gave them a perfect **example**. He said, 'This, then, is how you should pray...' and then he taught them the beautiful pattern we now call The Lord's Prayer."

* **Scene 4: The Result**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> The disciples now praying with confidence and peace. Their eyes are closed, and their faces are serene. They understand the pattern: start with praise, ask for needs, confess, and ask for help. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "By giving them a perfect 'one-shot' example, Jesus taught them the key parts of prayer. He didn't just tell them _to_ pray; he showed them _how_."

### **Screen 3: The Connection (The "Aha!" Moment)**

* **Component:** A clear comparison graphic showing a pattern.
* **Visuals:** A screen that looks like a "Pattern Guide."

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> A clean, educational graphic. On the left, key phrases from the Lord's Prayer are labeled: "Our Father" (Praise), "Give us this day" (Request), "Forgive us our debts" (Confession). On the right, a simple AI task: "Translate to a happy emoji." Example 1: Sad -> 🙂. Example 2: Angry -> 🙂. The visual connects the idea of a 'template for prayer' with a 'template for an AI task'. Minimalist flat design. --style raw
> ```

* **Main Text:** "**Jesus gave his disciples a pattern to follow.** This pattern taught them how to structure their own, personal prayers. Few-shot prompting works the exact same way: we give the AI a pattern with a few examples, and it learns how to apply that pattern to new tasks perfectly."

### **Screen 4: The Digital Workshop (Activity Hub)**

* **Component:** A menu screen: "Time to become a pattern-teacher!"

#### **Button 1: Juniors (9-11) - "The Pattern Painter"**

* **Activity:** Finish the Pattern!
  * **Component:** `DragAndDrop`.
  * **Task:** The app shows a pattern and asks the child to complete it.
    * **Example 1:** `Antonym Challenge! Hot -> Cold. Big -> Small. Day -> ?` The child drags the word "Night" from a list of options.
    * **Example 2:** `Animal Sounds! Cow -> Moo. Duck -> Quack. Pig -> ?` The child drags the word "Oink".
  * **Feedback:** A "Pattern Complete!" celebration animation when they get it right.

#### **Button 2: Teens (12-15) - "The Example Architect"**

* **Activity:** Teach the AI!
  * **Component:** `TextInput`.
  * **Task:** The app gives a goal, and the user must "teach" the AI by providing examples.
    * **Goal:** "Teach the AI to identify the main character from a Bible verse."
    * **Your Prompt:** _(User types in the prompt box)_
          `From the verse, identify the main character.`

          `Verse: "So the LORD said to Noah, 'Go into the ark, you and your whole family...'" -> Character: Noah`
          `Verse: "But Ruth replied, 'Don’t urge me to leave you...'" -> Character: Ruth`
          `Verse: "Early in the morning, David left the flock..." -> Character: ?`
  * **Interaction:** After the user types the final line, the app "simulates" the AI output by correctly typing "David".

### **Screen 5: The Takeaway (Final Reflection)**

* **Component:** A final summary screen.
* **Summary:** "Today's big idea: Don't just tell, _show_! Providing the AI with a few good examples (**few-shot prompting**) is one of the best ways to get accurate and perfectly formatted results."
* **Life & Faith Connection:** "Jesus didn't just teach with words; he taught with his life. He was the ultimate example of how to love God and love others. When you want to help someone learn something new, showing them an example is often kinder and more effective than just giving instructions. Be a good example, just like Jesus was."
* **Final Interaction:** A text input box asks: "What is one good example you can set for someone this week?"

---

## **Module 5: Thinking Step-by-Step (Chain-of-Thought)**

**Core Concept:** For complex problems, you can make the AI much more accurate by asking it to "think step-by-step" or "show its work." This breaks a big problem into smaller, easier pieces.
**Biblical Case Study:** The Wisdom of King Solomon (1 Kings 3:16-28).

### **Screen 1: The Concept (The Big Idea)**

* **Component:** A simple, two-stage animation.
* **Visuals:**
    1. **Stage 1 (No Step-by-Step):** A friendly robot is shown a complex math problem like `(7 + 3) * 4 = ?`. The robot's eyes spin, and it quickly holds up a sign with the wrong answer: "40".
    2. **Stage 2 (With Step-by-Step):** The robot is given the same problem, but with the instruction: "Solve this step by step." The robot first shows `Step 1: 7 + 3 = 10`. Then it shows `Step 2: 10 * 4 = 40`. It holds up a sign with the correct answer, looking proud.

> **Image Prompt for the robot's successful calculation:**
>
> ```
> A proud and happy cartoon robot holding up a sign with a correct math equation written on it. The robot has a confident smile. Next to it, a checklist shows 'Step 1: Complete' and 'Step 2: Complete'. Minimalist, educational, digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text Appears:** "For big problems, trying to find the answer in one jump can lead to mistakes. Breaking it down is the key!"
* **Core Definition:**
    > **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Instructing the AI to explain its reasoning process step-by-step before giving a final answer. This helps it "think" more logically and arrive at a better conclusion.

### **Screen 2: The Biblical Case Study (A King's Wise Judgment)**

* **Component:** Interactive, click-through story reel.
* **Title:** The Impossible Problem
* **Scene 1: The Problem**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> King Solomon on his throne, looking thoughtful and serious. Before him, two women are arguing emotionally, each holding onto the same baby. The court looks on with confusion. A scene of high drama and an impossible dilemma. Storybook illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "Two women came to King Solomon. Both claimed to be the mother of the same baby. There were no witnesses. It was one person's word against another. How could he discover the truth?"

* **Scene 2: The Rash Answer (Imagination)**

> **Image Prompt:**

> ```
> King Solomon flipping a giant gold coin in the air, with the two mothers looking on in horror. The scene looks like a gamble, not a wise judgment. A depiction of a poor, hasty decision-making process. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "Solomon couldn't just guess or flip a coin. A wrong answer would be a terrible injustice. He needed a process to reveal the truth."

* **Scene 3: The Step-by-Step Test (The Bible)**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> King Solomon, with a calm but commanding presence, speaking to a guard who is holding a large (but not threatening) sword. Solomon is not looking at the sword, but is intently watching the reactions of the two women. His eyes are narrowed in concentration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "So, the wise king created a step-by-step test. **Step 1:** He called for a sword. **Step 2:** He proposed the unthinkable: divide the living child in two. **Step 3:** He carefully watched how each woman would react to this terrible idea."

* **Scene 4: The Truth Revealed**

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> The true mother, with tears in her eyes, crying out "No!" with her hands outstretched towards the baby. The other woman stands silently with a stern face. The real mother's love is clearly visible. A powerful emotional climax. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text:** "The real mother's love made her cry out, 'Please, my lord, give her the living baby! Don’t kill him!' Solomon now had his answer. His step-by-step test had revealed the truth."

### **Screen 3: The Connection (The "Aha!" Moment)**

* **Component:** A clear comparison graphic showing a process.
* **Visuals:** A flowchart graphic titled "A Path to the Right Answer."

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```
> A simple and clean educational flowchart. On the left, a path shows icons for 'Problem' -> 'Test' -> 'Reaction' -> 'Truth'. On the right, a parallel path shows icons for 'Question' -> 'Step 1' -> 'Step 2' -> 'Answer'. The two paths show a similar logical progression. Minimalist flat design with connecting arrows. --style raw
> ```

* **Main Text:** "**Solomon didn't just ask for the answer; he created a _process_ to find it.** He used a logical chain of thought. When we ask an AI to 'think step-by-step,' we are asking it to do the same thing. This forces it to follow a logical path instead of guessing, which makes its final answer much more trustworthy."

### **Screen 4: The Digital Workshop (Activity Hub)**

* **Component:** A menu screen: "Time to be a problem-solver!"

#### **Button 1: Juniors (9-11) - "The Recipe Builder"**

* **Activity:** Order the Steps!
  * **Component:** `DragAndDrop`.
  * **Task:** The app shows the goal: "Build a small, simple house." All the steps are jumbled: "Put on the roof," "Build the walls," "Lay the foundation." The child must drag the steps into the correct, logical order.
  * **Feedback:** As they place a step correctly, a part of the house is built in an animation on screen.

#### **Button 2: Teens (12-15) - "The Problem Solver"**

* **Activity:** Write a Step-by-Step Prompt
  * **Component:** `TextInput`.
  * **Task:** The app presents a complex question. The user's job is to write a prompt that asks an AI to solve it using a step-by-step process.
    * **Problem:** "I want to host a movie night for my youth group. We need to pick a movie that is appropriate for ages 12-15, is an adventure or comedy, and is available on Netflix. We also need three snack ideas that don't contain nuts."
    * **Your Step-by-Step Prompt:** _(User types here, e.g., "Let's figure this out step by step. First, list three movies on Netflix that are adventure/comedies rated PG or PG-13. Second, for each movie, give a brief, one-sentence summary. Third, list three popular snack ideas that do not contain nuts.")_

### **Screen 5: The Takeaway (Final Reflection)**

* **Component:** A final summary screen.
* **Summary:** "Today's big idea: For tough problems, don't just ask for the answer. Ask the AI to **'think step-by-step.'** It's the secret to getting better, more accurate results on complex questions."
* **Life & Faith Connection:** "When you face a big decision or a problem that seems impossible, don't get overwhelmed. Be like Solomon. Take a deep breath and break it down. Ask yourself: 'What's the very first, small step I should take?' Praying for wisdom to see the next right step, instead of all the steps at once, can make any challenge feel more manageable."
* **Final Interaction:** A text input box asks: "What is a big task you have coming up? What is just the first step?"

## **Module 6: Capstone Project - Become a Bible Story Co-Creator**

**Core Concept:** Combine all five prompt engineering skills (Specificity, Persona, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought) to work with an AI and generate a unique, creative retelling of a classic Bible story.
**Biblical Case Study:** The user's choice! They become the director.

### **Screen 1: The Mission Briefing**

* **Component:** A "Project Start" screen.
* **Visuals:** The screen has a "TOP SECRET" folder animation that opens to reveal the mission.

> **Image Prompt:**
>
> ```text
> A digital file folder on a screen with a "Top Secret" stamp on it. The folder is slightly open, revealing a glowing document inside titled "Project: AI Co-Creator". The style is a fun, spy-themed mission briefing. Digital illustration. --ar 16:9 --style raw
> ```

* **Text Appears:** "Congratulations, agent. You've completed your training. Your final mission, should you choose to accept it, is to become a **Prompt Director**. You will use all your skills to work with an AI and create a brand new version of a famous Bible story. It's time to show what you know."

### **Screen 2: The Toolkit Review**

* **Component:** An interactive icon bar.
* **Visuals:** A screen displaying five distinct icons in a row, representing the five skills learned.

> **Image Prompts for Icons:**
>
> ```text
> 1. (Specificity): A clean, minimalist icon of a magnifying glass focusing on a single, glowing point. Flat design, vibrant blue.
> 2. (Persona): A clean, minimalist icon of a smiling theatrical mask next to a frowning one. Flat design, vibrant purple.
> 3. (Few-Shot): A clean, minimalist icon showing a pattern of 'A->B', 'C->D'. Flat design, vibrant green.
> 4. (Chain-of-Thought): A clean, minimalist icon of a chain with three links. Flat design, vibrant orange.
> 5. (Prompt Basics): A clean, minimalist icon of a simple speech bubble with a cursor in it. Flat design, vibrant grey.
> ```

* **Interaction:** The user can tap on each icon to get a one-sentence reminder. For example, tapping the mask icon reveals: "Persona: Tell the AI _who to be_ to change its style and tone."

### **Screen 3: The Project Workshop**

* **Component:** A multi-step guided project builder.

#### Step 1: Choose Your Story**

* **Interaction:** The user selects a story from a dropdown list (e.g., "Daniel in the Lion's Den," "Jonah and the Big Fish," "The Good Samaritan").

#### Step 2: Build Your "Master Prompt"**

* **Interaction:** The user fills out a series of fields to construct their prompt.

  * **The Persona Field:**
    * **Prompt:** "Who should tell this story?"
    * **User Input (Example):** "You are one of the lions in the den. You are old, wise, and have seen many things, but you have never seen anything like this."

  * **The Specificity Field:**
    * **Prompt:** "What key details or feelings must be included?"
    * **User Input (Example):** "Include the jealousy of the other advisors, the king's sadness, the feeling of the stone rolling over the den, and the calm presence of the angel."

  * **The Example Field (Few-Shot):**
    * **Prompt:** "Give the AI an example of the writing style you want."
    * **User Input (Example):** `Example sentence: "The night was cold in our den, but the man's faith felt warmer than any sun."`

  * **The Structure Field (Chain-of-Thought):**
    * **Prompt:** "How should the story be structured? Tell the AI the steps."
    * **User Input (Example):** "Let's tell this story step-by-step. First, describe your confusion when Daniel is thrown into your den. Second, explain the moment the angel appeared and why you couldn't touch him. Finally, describe your surprise when King Darius opened the den in the morning."

**Step 3: Generate!**
